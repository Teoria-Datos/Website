        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Founded by Leopoldo Bertossi & Javier Pinto. We are a research group specialized on Theoretical Computer Science, an important branch in the intersection of Computer Science and Mathematics. TCS includes two broad areas: Theory of Computation and Database Theory. The first area cover such topics as Algorithmics, Computational Complexity, Logic, Automata Theory and much more. And the second one such matters as Database Management Systems, Data Analysis, Applied Management of Data Structures and many others.</p>
