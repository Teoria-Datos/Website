        <h1>Demos</h1>
        <p>Here we present some implementations (demos) led by our group. These demos are coded by engineers and students from the group, where several algorithms were designed by our researchers and PhD/Master students. All demos are open source and we are welcome for new people that want to contribute to the projects.</p>
        <ul>
          <p><strong>Millennium DB</strong>: This is a full-fledged database management system for working with graph data, also called a graph database system. This system is led by the IMFD, with which our group actively collaborates. It uses the latest data structures and algorithms for evaluating graph queries efficiently. It also supports RDF data and SPARQL language, among other features. For more information, check the repo at https://github.com/MillenniumDB or the paper here or here.</p>
          <p><strong>REmatch</strong>: This is a novel regex engine for processing documents and extracting information using regular expressions (RegEx). It represents a new generation of regex engines providing new semantics and evaluation of RegEx to find all matches. REmatch uses new techniques from automata theory and enumeration algorithms studied and developed by our group.  For more information, check the repo at https://github.com/orgs/REmatchChile or the paper here.</p>
          <p><strong>CORE</strong>: This is a Complex Event REcognition engine for processing stream data online. Users can define situations of interest by declaring complex events through CEQL, CORE's query language developed for this purpose. Then, CORE evaluates CEQL queries using the latest automata techniques and streaming enumeration algorithms developed and studied by our group. You can read more information at https://github.com/orgs/CER-CORE or at the paper here.</p>
