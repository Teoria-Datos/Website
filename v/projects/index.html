        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Below you can see a list of our current research projects. If you want to participate in one of them, please contact the respective member of the group.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Millennium Institute of Foundational Research on Data (from the Millennium Science Initiative): The IMFD is a reference research center that brings together scientists from computer science, statistics, political sciences, and communications, aiming to develop interdisciplinary frontier science to address the foundational problems on data. It is a joint initiative led by the Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chile, where our group actively leads and participates. This research center arose as the natural evolution of the Semantic Web Research Center, a center that several researchers of our group led. For more info, check: https://imfd.cl/.</li>
          <li>Constant-delay algorithms for Complex Event Recognition (Fondecyt Regular): This project studies efficient algorithms for processing stream data, like sensor networks and social networks (e.g. X), among others. One can see stream data as a continuous sequence of events, where a piece of data represents each event. To extract information from it, a user defines patterns (i.e., queries) for recognizing complex events, a subsequence of events that represents a crucial situation in real life. These patterns must be evaluated efficiently, with strong guarantees regarding digesting a new event or enumerating new outputs. These projects look for such algorithms from a foundational perspective, using techniques from automata theory, logic, computational complexity, and streaming algorithms. For more info, write to Cristian Riveros, Dante Pinto, Amaranta Salas, or Julián García.</li>
